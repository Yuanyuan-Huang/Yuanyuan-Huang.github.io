  <h6 class="dropCap"><p>This impromptu journey sprouted from our desire to embrace nature's beauty. While I initially yearned for the enchanting trails of the Dolomite Mountains, David longed for tranquil evening fishing after a day of invigorating hikes.
    The task of finding a locale that marries breathtaking hiking routes with serene fishing spots proved more challenging than expected. Nevertheless, our quest led us to the splendid Moonsee area in Austria, where nature has generously blessed the landscape with three majestic lakes nestled amidst picturesque mountains.</p></h6>

    <h5 class="dropCap"><p>Day 1 Attersee hiking: to Schoberstein</p><p>Loop from Weissenbach am Attersee</p></h5>
    <h6 class="dropCap"><p>As we ventured into this captivating region, our senses were immediately captivated by the breathtaking vistas of majestic mountains and serene lakes. The popularity of this area became apparent, and sadly, finding an ideal camping spot by the lake proved elusive. Instead, we reluctantly considered the option of staying overnight in the roadside parking areas, albeit at the cost of enduring the constant noise from passing vehicles. The encircling road, with a speed limit of 70 km/hour, contributed to a cacophony that shattered the tranquility of the lakes and mountains, marring their natural beauty.</p>
    <p>The nearby hiking experience is truly remarkable, unfolding with enchanting charm. The journey commences through quaint forest trails, gradually revealing a magnificent vista overlooking the sparkling lake. The pinnacle of this adventure lies in traversing from Klein Schoberstein to Gross Schoberstein, where helpful lines along the rocks provide support for hikers, elevating the thrill of the ascent. However, it's worth considering weather conditions, as rainy days might make the climb challenging and warrant extra caution. This expedition is a delightful round trip, offering a diverse tapestry of landscapes to explore. Upon retracing our steps, we ventured through a tranquil logging forest, then followed the meandering paths of majestic rivers, passing picturesque house farms, and finally, we found ourselves back at the serene lakeside, completing a truly fulfilling journey.</p></h6>

    <h5 class="dropCap"><p>Day 2 & 3 Schwarzensee</p></h5>
    <h6 class="dropCap"><p>Fishing is prohibited in Attersee, and our search for camping sites near Moonsee and Wolfgangsee proved fruitless. Fortunately, a camping worker suggested Schwarzensee's parking place as an alternative. While the facilities were simple, lacking showers and modern amenities, the cost was budget-friendly at only 8 EUR for PKW and an additional 20 EUR for a day of fishing. </p>
    <p>As we journeyed to the spot, we were treated to a scenic route adorned with stunning mountains.
    The higher altitude of Schwarzensee brought a slight drop in temperature, but the trade-off was well worth it. The serenity of this location exceeded our expectations, far removed from the bustling lakes below. Here, the absence of crowds and noisy cars contributed to a peaceful atmosphere. Our fishing expedition at Schwarzensee proved to be a highlight of the trip. D caught three fish, which we later prepared and cooked in Thunderstorm, creating a delightful and memorable experience.</p><h6>

    <h5 class="dropCap"><p>Day 4 Obernberg</p></h5>
    <h6 class="dropCap"><p>The thunder and lightning graces our evenings regularly. However, as much as we admire its beauty, the intense rain and thunderstorms disrupt our sleep and tranquility during the evening hours. Consequently, we sought refuge in a sunnier region, where the absence of mountains allows for abundant sunshine and a more peaceful atmosphere.</p></h6>
