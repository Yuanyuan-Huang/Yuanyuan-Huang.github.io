  <p>With a PhD in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, I am well educated in the field of ecology. 
      I am a researcher, an analyst, and a data manager, motivated by the opportunity to work with scientific data. 
      In my personal life, I am also a passionate photographer and enjoy nature very much. 
      You can find some photos in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog">blog</a>.</p>
